  <p>Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/)[2] is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[3] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React[4]) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.[5] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.[6]</p>
